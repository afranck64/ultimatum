<!-- <h3 align="center">For each of the four panels of lotteries below, please indicate the lottery you would like to play.<br> The chances of getting a given reward are proportional to the associated probability. Your bonus for this task is your average gain on all panels.</h3> -->
<p align="center">In this task we ask you to choose one of the ten alternatives of each panel. Each alternative is a lottery defined as a combination of the probability of winning and of the amount (in USD cents) you  will  earn  if  the  favorable  result  occurs.  If  the  favorable  result  does  not  occur,  you  get nothing. In the case of choosing the probability 1 (with payoff equal to 1 USD cent), this choice implies that you will get 1 USD cent on that panel for sure.</p>
<p align="center">Earning: A 10-sided die is tossed. Note that: The 10 side numbers are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4,â€¦, 8 or 9. The number shown by the die determines the upper limit of winning numbers.  If,  for  example,  the  die  shows  an  8,  all  numbers  except  9  win.  Thus, everyone gets  the  prize that  corresponds  to  the  chosen lottery,  except for those ones that played the 10% lottery. The ones that play the 20% lottery need at least an 8. The ones choosing 30% need at least a 7 to win. And so on and so forth</p>
<h3 align="center">Observe the following 4 panels and take your decision. Remember that you must choose one option for each panel. Your bonus for this task is your average gain on all panels.</h3>
