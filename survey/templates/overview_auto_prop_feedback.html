<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Welcome to our task! All participants will remain anonymous throughout the whole task. Please read the instructions carefully. To ensure your understanding the main task will begin only after you answer four questions about the task correctly. Your income ranges from a minimum of 0.50 USD to a maximum of {{ "%.2f"|format((max_gain + 50)/100)}} USD and depends on your actions and the actions by another participant, as explained in more detail below.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">In the task you are expected to make <strong><u>one decision</u>.</strong> At the beginning, two participants are randomly matched together. You and the other participant make your decisions separately, without knowing what the other one is doing.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">One of you is randomly assigned the role of a <strong>PROPOSER</strong> and the other is assigned the role of a <strong>RESPONDER</strong>. Initially, the <strong>PROPOSER</strong> receives {{ "%.2f"|format(max_gain / 100)}} USD and needs to make an offer to the <strong>RESPONDER</strong> on how to split this money. The <strong>RESPONDER</strong> can either accept or reject this offer. If the <strong>RESPONDER</strong> accepts the offer, the {{ "%.2f"|format(max_gain / 100)}} USD are split according to the offer. If the <strong>RESPONDER</strong> rejects, both the participants receive nothing (0.00 USD).</span></p>

<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">In this task, the <strong>PROPOSER</strong> will be represented by an autonomous artificial intelligence system (AI System). The <strong>PROPOSER</strong> offer will thus be determined by the system, and not by a human. The earnings of the AI System will be transferred to the human <strong>PROPOSER</strong>.</span></p>
